An interface can contain variables and the main purpose of interface variable is to define
requirement level constants.
Inside interface every variable is by default is -> public static final, because ------>>>


1. public -> so that it can be accessed from every implementation class

2. static -> as we can't create object of the class and these variables are class level

3. final -> for interface multiple class implements it. If one class changes a variable value,
			then every class will be affected as the variable is static
