/*
Anonymous Inner class that extends a class : We can have an anonymous inner class 
that extends a class.For example,we know that we can create a thread by extending a Thread class. 
Suppose we need an immediate thread but we donâ€™t want to create a class that extend 
Thread class all the time. By the help of this type of Anonymous Inner class 

we can define a ready thread as follows:
*/

//Java program to illustrate creating an immediate thread 
//Using Anonymous Inner class that extends a Class 
class MyThread { 
	
	public static void main(String[] args) { 
		//Here we are using Anonymous Inner class 
		//that extends a class i.e. Here a Thread class 
		Thread t = new Thread() { 
			
			public void run() { 
				System.out.println("Child Thread"); 
			} 
		}; 

		t.start(); 
		System.out.println("Main Thread"); 
	} 
} 

// Main Thread
// Child Thread
