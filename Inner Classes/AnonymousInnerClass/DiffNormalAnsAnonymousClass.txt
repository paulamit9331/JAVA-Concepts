1.  A normal class can implement any number of interfaces but anonymous inner class can implement 
	only one interface at a time.

2.  A regular class can extend a class and implement any number of interface simultaneously. But anonymous Inner 
	class can extend a class or can implement an interface but not both at a time.

3.	For regular/normal class, we can write any number of constructors but we cant write any constructor for 	
	anonymous Inner class because anonymous class does not have any name and while defining constructor class name 
	and constructor name must be same.
